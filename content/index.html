        <h5>Description</h5>
        <p id="description">My favorite cookies in the whole wide world are these oatmeal raisin cookies. They're a little chewy in the center and a little crispy at the edges. Each bite is loaded with oats and sweet bursts of raisins. My grandmother used to bake oatmeal raisin cookies with me from the time I was old enough to stand on a chair and hold a spoon. Making these cookies taught me how to measure, how scrape down the sides of a mixing bowl, and the purest pleasure of all—licking the bowl.</p>
        
        <h6>Ingredients</h6>
        <p id="ingredients">
            1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened, OR 1 cup shortening <br>    
            1 cup brown sugar (light or dark), packed <br>    
            1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons (10 tablespoons) granulated sugar <br>           
            2 large eggs <br>
            1 tablespoon vanilla extract <br>
            1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour <br>
            1/2 teaspoon salt <br>
            1 teaspoon baking soda <br>
            1 teaspoon ground cinnamon <br>
            1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg <br>
            1 1/2 cups raisins <br>
            1/2 cup chopped walnuts, optional <br>
            3 cups rolled oats (old-fashioned or quick; do NOT use instant) <br>
        </p>

        <h6>Instructions</h6>
        <p id="instructions">
            1. Preheat the oven and prep the cookie sheets. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease 2 large cookie sheets or line with Silpat or parchment paper. <br>
            2. Combine the butter, sugar, and eggs: In a large mixing bowl, beat the butter until creamy. Add the brown sugar and white sugar and beat until fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in the eggs one at a time. Add the vanilla extract. <br>
            3. Add the dry ingredients: Mix the flour, salt, baking soda, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in medium bowl. Stir the dry ingredients into the butter-sugar mixture. Stir in the raisins and nuts. Stir in the oats. <br>
            4. Scoop out the dough: Spoon out the dough by large tablespoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets, leaving at least 2 inches between each cookie. <br>
            5. Bake the cookies: Bake until the edges of the cookies turn golden brown, about 10 to 12 minutes. If baking 2 cookie sheets at once, swap their positions on the racks mid-bake. Note that the cookies will seem underdone and lightly colored everywhere but the edges. That's okay, they will firm up as they cool. Repeat with the remaining cookie dough. <br>
            6. Cool, transfer, and store: Cool 1 minute on the cookie sheets. Then carefully remove them, using a metal spatula, to a wire rack. Cool completely. They will be quite soft until completely cooled. Store tightly covered at room temperature for up to 5 days. <br>
