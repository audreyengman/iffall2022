                    Pillowy, tender, and bursting with a generous amount of juicy blueberries and zippy lemon, these Vegan Blueberry Muffins are sure to become a favorite in your household.
                    With their bountiful muffin tops and a crunchy and caramelized walnut crumble topping, these are next-level bakery-style muffins that are a step above your standard muffin.
                    Bonus: they’re easy to make gluten-free (and they’re neither gummy nor dry!) and they freeze perfectly.

                <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>2½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>

                <li>¼ cup + 2 tbsp. canola oil</li>

                <h3>instructions</h3>
                <h4>Step 1- Combine the ingredients</h4>
                <li>To start, we must first make our “buttermilk”. To do this, mix together soymilk with 1 teaspoon of apple cider vinegar and set it aside for 5 minutes to curdle. Once it’s curdled, whisk in the sugar, oil, vanilla extract, and lemon zest.
                    Pro Tip: The curdled milk helps give these muffins rise and texture. While other types of non-dairy milk will do, I find that soy milk curdles the best. In a small bowl whisk together the dry ingredients. That’s the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Whisk until it’s well combined and set aside. Add the wet ingredients to the dry and mix until all the flour is evenly hydrated.</li>
                
                <h4>Step 2- Fold in the blueberries</h4>

                <li>Once the batter is made, we want to gently fold in the blueberries. The goal with folding is to get the blueberries fully incorporated into the batter without overmixing the batter or breaking apart the berries. To do this, use a wooden spoon or plastic spatula and fold the batter from bottom to top in a “C” shape. </li>
                
                <h4>Step 3- Bake the muffins</h4>

                <li>Scoop your batter into a greased muffin tin. Fill each muffin mold about ¾ of the way full and bake for 20-22 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. Pro Tip: I find that using an ice cream scoop is the cleanest and easiest way to get the batter into the muffin molds. With an ice cream scoop, you can ensure the muffins are equally sized as well. Remove the muffins from the oven and let them cool in the muffin tin for 10 minutes before flipping out to a wire cooling rack to cool completely.</li>
