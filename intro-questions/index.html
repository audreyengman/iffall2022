        <p>1. My name is Audrey Engman. I am a junior studying Communication Design.</p>
        <p>2. I want to pursue User Experience Design and User Interface Design. This past summer I worked as a UX Designer in the Digital Technology Development Program at GE HealthCare. </p>
        <p>3. I have very little experience with coding. We did a little bit of CSS last Spring in Type 1.</p>
        <p>4. I want to learn how to feel comfortable making a simple website. I would really like to build my own portfolio site. Additionally, it would be helpful to have contextual knowledge of what software developers are doing.</p>
        <p>5. As a designer for screens, you must consider the various types of devices someone may be accessing your designs on. It could be a phone, tablet, computer, tv, etc. </p>
        <p>6. Airbnb https://www.airbnb.com/a/stays?c=.pi0.pk36239956_25650614176&ghost=true&gclid=Cj0KCQjw39uYBhCLARIsAD_SzMQQi3ss0Cwd8RoUq6h1epv5FLAVNnd2D0AFba7l5XLY2KUB-ZNkWqEaApQEEALw_wcB . I love Airbnb's site as it is extremely intuitive and prioritizes the customer function of finding a place to stay as soon as you arrive on the site. I also really like their wishlist function.</p>
        <p>7. Pay Pal https://www.paypal.com/us/home . Pay Pal clearly states the incentives for creating an account and how to proceed from the moment a customer lands on their home page.</p>
        <p>8. Apple's Support https://support.apple.com/ . Apple does a really great job of solving a problem as efficiently and sleekly as possible. It is very intuitive and easy to navigate their support and find help with a specific product.</p>
